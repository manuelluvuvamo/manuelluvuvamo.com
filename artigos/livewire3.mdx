Prior to Livewire, developers who chose to use Laravel as their development tool faced significant challenges when it came to the performance of their applications, one of the most frequent of which was developing SPAs.
<br/>
### <span className="text-xl"><b>SPA - Single Page Application</b></span>
<br/>
This is a web application or software that imitates the rendering of views like a desktop application, without loading the page in the browser and without changing the main structure of the page, just loading the body of the application, i.e. a single page web application. In order to have this effect similar to that of frameworks such as React and Vue, many devs used Ajax instead, which makes the application less performant. As Laravel evolved, integration with React and Vue emerged and significantly changed the way applications were developed.
<br/>
Nowadays, for a long time, Livewire has given us a new vision and makes it possible to have reactive loading of the body of the page through its “wire” methods.
<br/>
Version 3 of Livewire has simplified a lot of things, I particularly like it and strongly recommend it for those who want to build SPA's in a simple way without leaving Laravel, all dispatchers have been shortened to just dispatch, listeners have been removed and the wire is enough to asynchronously trigger functions in Livewire components.
