After a period of poor performance and few new developments in my professional profile as a developer, in the last few days I've had some brilliant ideas that have made me go back to studying concepts and technologies that I hadn't dealt with for years. I've started a new journey actively studying tools that make it easier for me to create web solutions in the import and dropshipping sector because of a project idea related to Quick and Safe Shopping.
<br/>
Since January 19th, I've been refreshing and updating my knowledge of WordPress, a powerful PHP framework that makes it possible to do much more than simple Blogs and LandingPages. I've watched about 10 hours of various tutorials where I've successfully replicated three (3) interesting projects, two Service LandingPages and a Blog.
<br/>
Over the next few days I will be developing the solutions I have devised for importing and dropshipping in Angola in a safe way. I still have a lot of study ahead of me in order to be able to handle a huge range of plugins and tools, but as soon as I complete the projects I will share them on all my professional profiles.

### <span className="text-xl"> <b>Pricing for website development</b> </span>
<br/>

Pricing is one of the biggest headaches for any freelance developer or programmer, and during my training and refresher process I was able to come across and answer some pertinent questions that help in this process. Some of the questions to answer for good pricing are:
<br/>

1. How many days a month do you want to work?
 a. How many hours a day?
 b. How many websites can you do in that time?

2. How much do you spend each month?
 a. For example, if you plan to work 21 days a month (with weekends off) and about 8 hours a day, how many websites can you create in that time?
<br/>
Let's assume that your monthly expenses, such as rent, food, internet, work tools and other bills are around kz 338,965.86 per month, developing at least 5 sites per month, making a basic calculation each site would cost an average of 67,793.17. It is vital to put a profit margin on top of this, for example if you put a 50% profit margin you would earn kz 508,448.79 and divide this by 5 sites, each of which would have to be sold for an average of kz 101,689.76.

You can never have too much knowledge. Keep studying, embrace new challenges and success awaits!
